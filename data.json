Upstream Ag Insights Focal Points for 2023\n\nI began writing about the topics, themes and interests for Upstream for 2023\\. However, I kept coming back to the fact that they weren’t that much different than 2022\\. \n\nThere are some slight adjustments, such as the “Public Offering Window Closing on AgTech” from 2022 \\(I think the window is very shut at this point\\) moving towards “Capital Raising Headwinds Picking Up Steam in 2023”\\. \n\nThe majority were just extension of what I had last year\\. \n\nWith that, it’s easiest to read what I put together last year if you wish and over the coming weeks I’ll highlight some of the nuances I am watching and looking at for 2023\\.\n\n#### [Upstream Ag Insights Outlook 2022](https://substack.com/redirect/ef1a9650-545c-4e93-9a53-1012c183aeb3?j=eyJ1IjoibDBkZnQifQ.fsAsk8magfZaWcX6H0SxlYdc0KZrRwFfldzz0UlOn70) \\- Upstream Ag Insights\n\n### **2\\. [Carbon By Indigo Pays $3\\.7 Million In Second Tranche of Payments](https://substack.com/redirect/9783f883-81cc-4ede-a296-00e60dfe0fa4?j=eyJ1IjoibDBkZnQifQ.fsAsk8magfZaWcX6H0SxlYdc0KZrRwFfldzz0UlOn70) \\- The Daily Scoop**\n\nThis is the second time this year Indigo has announced payments via their carbon program\\. Overall, it’s encouraging to see payments being made in the carbon space\\. \n\n> *Farmers earned $30 per carbon credit sold in Carbon by Indigo’s second round of payments\\.*\n> \n> \n\nThis number seems consistent with their statements earlier in 2022 where their CEO said \n\n> *As we started our journey, we've watched the price double in the last two years\\. We've now arrived at $40 a credit is what they're buying\\. And there's so much more demand\\.*\n> \n> \n\nThe $30 “payment to farmers” is consistent with the $40/MT statement and just includes the Indigo 25% take rate off the top of the price\\. \n\nIndigo stated that there were 450 growers participating in the payments this time around\\. At the stated farmer price per MT of $30 and $3\\.7 million in total attributable to the farmer, that means **Indigo sold 123,300 MT of carbon offsets\\.** \n\n**This works out to 274 credits per farmer, or about $8,200 on average per farmer\\.** \n\nFor context, the first tranche Indigo stated that there were 175 participating farmers selling a total of 20,000\\. Working out to 114 credits per farmer\\. \n\nNot only has Indigo grown the total farmer number accessing credits, they are increasing the average per farmer\\. Given the still small numbers in the context of the industry size, it’s worth mentioning that this could be skewed still by a farmer or two, but encouraging that there is growing interest\\. \n\nHow does this meet their previously stated expectations though?\n\nIn June 2022 they stated the following:\n\n> *Indigo says it will announce its second credit issuance early next year\\. Currently, Carbon by Indigo has 2,000 farmers who have enrolled almost 5 million acres\\.*\n> \n> \n\nBasic math tells us that **only about 23% of their 5000 farmers enrolled are accessing credits as of today**\\. If we take this down a level to the acre and assume 0\\.5MT sequestered per acre, **we get about 246,000 acres delivering a successful credit\\.** If they have 5 million acres signed up, that means **only about 5% of acres are actually qualifying for credits** \n\n*\\(Note: The amount of carbon sequestered per acre could be less, but even if it is 0\\.25MT/ac, then 10% of acres are qualifying and if it’s 0\\.1MT/ac then only 25% of acres are qualifying\\. My assumption is that it’s unlikely to be much above 0\\.5MT/ac\\.\\)*\n\nAs a follow up to when I covered their initial tranche, let’s calculate the Indigo Carbon revenue from this second tranche\\. \n\nIndigo Carbon has a credit share of 75% to the farmer and 25% kept for themselves\\. \n\nBased on the verbiage used in previous interviews that the price per MT they were obtaining would be $40 and the “farmers earned $30 per carbon credit” in previous CEO statements, we can assume that Indigo’s take of each credit was approximately $10\\. \n\nWith the calculation above showing us they sold approximately 123,300 we can assume **their total revenue comes out to $1\\.23 million from this second tranche\\.**\n\nCombined with my \\(probably high\\) assumptions from their first tranche of $200,000, that would bring **Indigo Carbon business unit revenue to $1\\.43 million for 2022\\.** \n\nIndigo has raised a total of $1\\.2 billion\\.\n\n## 3\\. John Deere News\n\nJohn Deere released their 2022 10K in December and just like they did last year, had a push of messaging about their new tech and products surrounding the Consumer Electronic Show\\. With that, there is a lot of different Deere related news to highlight\\. \n\n### a\\. John Deere Executives at the Consumer Electronic Show 2023\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_550,c_limit/l_youtube_play_qyqt8q,w_120/1kjZMHZl538)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kjZMHZl538)\n\nDeere had their executives do a keynote presentation at CES \\(starts at 34 min mark\\)\\. It’s well done so I linked it above, however, if you are going to spend the time I would recommend prioritizing their **[Leaps Unlocked Event from May of 2022](https://substack.com/redirect/36855ba0-8163-4ddc-8926-3605491ed896?j=eyJ1IjoibDBkZnQifQ.fsAsk8magfZaWcX6H0SxlYdc0KZrRwFfldzz0UlOn70)** for a deeper dive\\.\n\nWith that said, they did make one notable announcement at CES regarding ExactShot:\n\n### b\\. [John Deere Debuts New Planting Technology & Electric Excavator During CES 2023 Keynote](https://substack.com/redirect/3649d488-7408-453b-a17b-6a59e1348845?j=eyJ1IjoibDBkZnQifQ.fsAsk8magfZaWcX6H0SxlYdc0KZrRwFfldzz0UlOn70) \\- PR Newswire\n\n> *ExactShot allows farmers to reduce the amount of starter fertilizer needed during planting by more than 60%\\. The technology uses sensors and robotics to place starter fertilizer precisely onto seeds as they are planted in the soil, rather than applying a continuous flow of fertilizer to the entire row of seeds\\.*\n> \n> \n\nThe technology and product announced are exciting\\. I think it opens the door for more capabilities that I’ll get into further down, but I also think Deere is being a bit aggressive in their positioning surrounding this tech and it’s ability to mitigate starter fertilizer usage\\. Let me elaborate\\. \n\nApplying what would be the equivalent of a nutrient starter onto/near the seed is great\\. I have frequently talked about the battle of crop input companies to be **on or near the seed growing drastically in the coming decade\\.** The new Deere functionality brings unique opportunity for biostimulants and nutrients of all kinds which is a net positive for farmers and input manufacturers alike\\. With that said, decreasing starter fertilizer by 60% is an aggressive statement\\. And to be clear, they state “*starter fertilizer*”, not total fertilizer\\. \n\nSeeds are not the primary target for nutrients, generally speaking \\(though **[seeds do benefit from the right nutrient/form](https://substack.com/redirect/2b400ea9-f9af-4b8b-b132-c48546b32ea1?j=eyJ1IjoibDBkZnQifQ.fsAsk8magfZaWcX6H0SxlYdc0KZrRwFfldzz0UlOn70)** and appropriate load directly applied\\)\\. Roots however are **highly equipped** to seek out and uptake major macronutrients\\. Plant roots evolved this way\\. For context, corn roots after germination **[initially grow at a rate](https://substack.com/redirect/d2fe3a4a-aa07-4972-a90b-9d2cd46df2d0?j=eyJ1IjoibDBkZnQifQ.fsAsk8magfZaWcX6H0SxlYdc0KZrRwFfldzz0UlOn70)** of about 0\\.3”/day up to 5th\\-leaf and from then on with a rate of 1\\.2” /day\\. And a 35,000 corn plant population on 30” rows has about **[6” between plants in a row](https://substack.com/redirect/297bd0f5-06a0-4a35-b6ff-356418e17058?j=eyJ1IjoibDBkZnQifQ.fsAsk8magfZaWcX6H0SxlYdc0KZrRwFfldzz0UlOn70)\\.** \n\nSo when we consider that once corn germinates, the roots grow out and down about 3” every 10 days, we essentially see corn plants that are side by side in a row likely having their roots close to touching in the soil across the row\\. Starter fertilizer is important, but the need for nutrients doesn’t decrease afterwards, the demand continually grows throughout the season\\. While making some nutrients initially easier to access for the crop does come with an efficiency factor, a consistent 60% reduction seems unlikely for most farmers\\. \n\nAgain, not intended to be a knock on the product, simply highlighting aggressive positioning\\. Given the macro trends around sustainability and fertilizer, it’s not surprising that their marketing team emphasized the way they did\\. \n\nWith that said, the ExactShot technology does lay an incredible foundation to precisely apply nutrients, biostimulants and even fungicides, insecticides etc moving forward\\. If I am an input manufacturer, this technology presents an opportunity to collaborate and understand how it will impact recommendations and yield response to products\\. \n\nThe next step for Deere is to leverage their **precision application capabilities with** **precision intelligence** surrounding the soil\\. \n\nSensors that in real time assess temperature and moisture level of the soil can influence the amount of and type of product applied, so they become a natural next step\\. This capability also holds immense potential value surrounding seed survivability numbers, disease risk insight and more\\. \n\nThe next step after that leverages spectroscopy: \n\n> *branch of science concerned with the investigation and measurement of spectra produced when matter interacts with or emits electromagnetic radiation\\.*\n> \n> \n\nA fancy way of saying equipping a piece of equipment with sensors that can assess the types of and levels of nutrients in the soil\\. \n\nThe benefit is that this would give a high resolution map of the soil physical and chemical make up which is useful in and of itself\\. But as the technology improves, **one can imagine how not only are they exact applying nutrients based on where the seed is, but where the nutrients aren’t**\\. Meaning, as a crop is being planted, the equipment adjusts the rate of nutrients delivered in real time\\. \n\nThis is essentially taking the likes of Stenon or SoilCares sensor technology and giving enabling ability to not only rapidly process, but adjust product type, rates and row application accordingly\\. I have been interested in this technology for years and been **[talking about the pairing of it with equipment since the beginning of Upstream](https://substack.com/redirect/3a0eaea5-3e1c-4e33-86ee-998a3cf48be1?j=eyJ1IjoibDBkZnQifQ.fsAsk8magfZaWcX6H0SxlYdc0KZrRwFfldzz0UlOn70)**\\.\n\nTo be clear, my conversations with companies specializing in spectroscopy has been that the calibration of spectroscopy tech itself has been tricky to calibrate across soil types and we are still a bit away from real time, rapid analysis\\. With that said, directionally we can see where Deere is likely to go in the coming decade with ExactShot\\. \n\nExactShot is another example of Deere being being well positioned to enable agronomic value to farmers through technology in the future\\. \n\nOne of the most popular Upstream articles from last year was **[John Deere to Crop Input Companies: “Your Margin is My Opportunity”](https://substack.com/redirect/d7e54dd6-2738-419d-b83b-0d991903f4a3?j=eyJ1IjoibDBkZnQifQ.fsAsk8magfZaWcX6H0SxlYdc0KZrRwFfldzz0UlOn70)** and you can see the applicability of it even in this announcement\\.\n\n### **c\\. \\*[InnerPlant Croptastic Podcast with John Deere](https://substack.com/redirect/051e3d67-ff3c-40d1-87c8-c1da5f5cf418?j=eyJ1IjoibDBkZnQifQ.fsAsk8magfZaWcX6H0SxlYdc0KZrRwFfldzz0UlOn70) \\- Croptastic**\n\nThis is a good podcast with John Deere\\. \n\nIf interested in the InnerPlant and John Deere connection check out this write\\-up co\\-authored with my friend Matt Coutts in September 2022:\n\n#### **[John Deere Leads InnerPlant’s $16M Series A: The Beginning of the Internet of Plants](https://substack.com/redirect/fbc39118-4e44-458b-9eb1-a080f9498589?j=eyJ1IjoibDBkZnQifQ.fsAsk8magfZaWcX6H0SxlYdc0KZrRwFfldzz0UlOn70) \\- Upstream Ag Insights**\n\nThere were a couple areas that really interested me in this podcast\\. \n\nThe first, was regarding the “plant as the ultimate sensor” that was emphasized in the podcast, which is true\\. When a plant is seeing a lack of nitrogen, you visually see it\\. When it is heat stressed, you visibly see it\\. And InnerPlant will deliver these visuals even earlier, which is great\\. \n\nThe challenge, specifically today without InnerPlant, is that the plant itself is actually a lagging indicator\\. Environmental stress, shortages of nutrients in the soil, or soil borne disease all can create conditions that lead to stress, which are ultimately eroding yield and quality from the moment the plant experiences them\\.\n\nTo contextualize lagging indicators: A bank account \\(at its simplest\\) is a lagging indicator of value added to society minus expenditures\\. A persons weight \\(at its simplest\\) is a lagging indicator of activity plus/minus caloric deficit or surplus \\(diet\\) \\+ genetics\\. \n\nLagging indicators have a time lag between the action, or stress, creating that signal which means the feedback loop is not tight enough \\(or there isn’t an opportunity for an intervention event\\) and we can benefit from other information to inform our decisions earlier to derive better outcomes\\. \n\nThis leads to the biggest point of leverage being an understanding of the soil to be able to take **proactive** action for controllables \\(like nutrient management, soil borne disease etc\\) \\+ leveraging InnerPlant to see earlier how the plants are responding\\. \n\nJohn Deere is uniquely positioned in this regard\\. \n\nThe data from both soil and plant in concerted fashion becomes incredibly powerful\\. If we go back up a story to ExactShot and my view of the next iterations of it surrounding spectroscopy in combination with InnerPlant trait sensing, Deere eventually empowers growers not with the ultimate sensor, but the **ultimate roadmap** to navigate and optimize crop production\\. Apply data science to this “map” and you can see the significant value Deere can eventually deliver \\- moving ever closer towards true prescriptive analytics:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_518,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e44fa0d-76d2-454b-a742-c9b1415760c1_518x310.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e44fa0d-76d2-454b-a742-c9b1415760c1_518x310.png)\n\n##### Source: Gartner\n\nNext, they talked about \"plant by plant management\"\\. To the Deere contributors points, they are already doing plant by plant management today when considering see and spray technology\\. \n\nWhat is interesting is taking that a step further regarding plant by plant optimization of the crop and get specific to the crop level\\. \n\nSoybean and corn to me make a lot of sense to have plant by plant management\\. They have \\\\~30\\-60,000 plants per acre equalling 0\\.75\\-1\\.5 plants per square foot\\.\n\nThen if we look at a wheat crop/other cereal crops we have 1 to 1\\.5 million plants per acre equalling 25\\-35 plants per square foot\\! They are literally all touching leaves by the time they reach roughly 4\\-5 weeks old \\(depending on row spacing\\)\\. Then factor in that their roots are inherently intertwined in the soil, leading to very similar exposure to stress events or access to nutrients\\. \n\nAn interesting question in my mind becomes, can we and do we need to manage every plant in a cereal setting? Is a 1 foot by 1 foot radius good enough? Does it change the economic dynamics for the farmer? Does it speed up or hinder Deere’s ability to deliver value in the market in cereals vs\\. corn or soybean?\n\nCheck out the podcast if you are interested in hearing more about what Deere is up to\\. \n\n##### \\*Disclosure: I am an investor in InnerPlant\n\n### d\\.

This is a form of fintech because it enables online payments\\.\n\nThen we get to SaaS Level 3: software revenue \\+ embedded payments \\+ everything else…Credit, insurance, instant payouts, loyalty, access to green lending and all of that across various points up and down the value chain\\. \n\nEach incremental SaaS level increases revenue, switching costs and margins for the SaaS company\\. It also increases value delivered to the original customer of the SaaS company\\. That value can come in numerous ways, but the easiest way to summarize it is “friction reduction”\\. Reduced paperwork to pay bills or access financing, less enhanced speed to approval or payments etc\\. So we can see the desire for SaaS companies to move in this direction, specifically enterprise SaaS in ag where the number of prospects is low on a relative basis\\. And on the flip side, we can see why banks, credit companies etc want to partner up with SaaS businesses: access to new customers\\. \n\nThis SaaS evolution view stems from one of the first ever non\\-ag articles I linked within Upstream from a16z: **[Every Company Will Be a Fintech Company](https://substack.com/redirect/ca83e0f2-f86c-4562-8f8d-a2a8b3590122?j=eyJ1IjoibDBkZnQifQ.fsAsk8magfZaWcX6H0SxlYdc0KZrRwFfldzz0UlOn70)\\.**\n\nTying this back to the enterprise point: **a large majority of software as a service companies in North American agriculture are** **enterprise driven**\\.
